An inbound lead qualification and research agent built with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/), [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), [Workflow DevKit](https://useworkflow.dev/), and the [Vercel Slack Adapter](https://github.com/vercel-labs/slack-bolt). Hosted on the [Vercel AI Cloud](https://vercel.com/blog/the-ai-cloud-a-unified-platform-for-ai-workloads).

**_This is meant to serve as a reference architecture to be adapted to the needs of your specific organization._**

## Overview

Lead agent app that captures a lead in a contact sales form and then kicks off a qualification workflow and deep research agent. It integrates with Slack to send and receive messages for human-in-the-loop feedback.

- **Immediate Response** - Returns a success response to the user upon submission
- **Workflows** - Uses Workflow DevKit to kick off durable background tasks
  - **Deep Research Agent** - Conducts comprehensive research on the lead with a deep research agent
  - **Qualify Lead** - Uses `generateObject` to categorize the lead based on the lead data and research report
  - **Write Email** - Generates a personalized response email
  - **Human-in-the-Loop** - Sends to Slack for human approval before sending
  - **Slack Webhook** - Catches a webhook event from Slack to approve or deny the email

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org)
- **Durable execution**: [Workflow DevKit](http://useworkflow.dev/)
- **AI**: [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) with [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway)
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: [Slack Bolt + Vercel Slack Bolt adapter](https://vercel.com/templates/ai/slack-agent-template)
- **Web Search**: [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai/)

## Using this template

This repo contains various empty functions to serve as placeholders. To fully use this template, fill out empty functions in `lib/services.ts`.

Example: Add a custom implementation of searching your own knowledge base in `queryKnowledgeBase`.

Additionally, update prompts to meet the needs of your specific business function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Slack workspace with bot token and signing secret
  - Reference the [Vercel Slack agent template docs](https://github.com/vercel-partner-solutions/slack-agent-template) for creating a Slack app
  - You can set the permissions and configuration for your Slack app in the `manifest.json` file in the root of this repo. Paste this manifest file into the Slack dashboard when creating the app
  - **Be sure to update the request URL for interactivity and event subscriptions to be your production domain URL**
  - If Slack environment variables are not set, the app will still run with the Slack bot disabled
- [Vercel AI Gateway API Key](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys%3Futm_source%3Dai_gateway_landing_page&title=Get+an+API+Key)
- [Exa API key](https://exa.ai/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/lead-agent.git
cd lead-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the following variables:

```bash
# Vercel AI Gateway API Key
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY

# Slack Bot
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID

# Exa API Key
EXA_API_KEY
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application and submit a test lead.

## Key Features

### Workflow durable execution with `use workflow`

This project uses [Workflow DevKit](https://useworkflow.dev) to kick off a workflow that runs the agent, qualification, and other actions.

### AI-Powered Qualification

Leads are automatically categorized (QUALIFIED, FOLLOW_UP, SUPPORT, etc.) using the latest OpenAI model via the Vercel AI SDK and `generateObject`. Reasoning is also provided for each qualification decision. Edit the qualification categories by changing the `qualificationCategorySchema` in `lib/types.ts`.

### AI SDK Agent class

Uses the [AI SDK Agent class](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/agents/overview) to create an autonomous research agent. Create new tools for the Agent and edit prompts in `lib/services.ts`.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

Generated emails are sent to Slack with approve/reject buttons, ensuring human oversight before any outbound communication.

The Slack message is defined with [Slack's Block Kit](https://docs.slack.dev/block-kit/). It can be edited in `lib/slack.ts`.

### Extensible Architecture

- Add new qualification categories in the `qualificationCategorySchema` in `types.ts`
- Adjust the prompts and configuration for all AI calls in `lib/services.ts`
- Alter the agent by tuning parameters in `lib/services.ts`
- Add new service functions if needed in `lib/services.ts`
- Follow [Vercel Workflow docs](https://useworkflow.dev) to add new steps to the workflow
- Create new workflows for other qualification flows, outbound outreach, etc.
